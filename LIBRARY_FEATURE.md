# Library Feature Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ What's New: Library View

We've successfully implemented the **Library View** feature that completes the core user experience:

### ðŸ“± Flutter Frontend - Library Screen

**Created Files:**
- `lib/models/story.dart` - Data model for stories with formatting helpers
- `lib/services/story_library_service.dart` - Service to fetch stories from backend
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart` - Full-featured library UI

**Features:**
- âœ… **Fetch Stories**: Connects to backend `/stories` API
- âœ… **Beautiful UI**: Modern Material Design with cards and icons
- âœ… **Search & Filter**: Search by filename, filter by category (All/Text/Audio)
- âœ… **Sort Options**: Sort by date, name, or file size
- âœ… **Responsive**: Handles loading, error, and empty states
- âœ… **Story Details**: Shows file type, size, upload date
- âœ… **Pull to Refresh**: Swipe down to reload stories
- âœ… **Category Badges**: Visual indicators for text vs audio stories

**Updated Files:**
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Enhanced home screen with better design
- `lib/main.dart` - Added library route navigation

### ðŸ”§ Backend - Stories API

**Features:**
- âœ… **GET /stories endpoint**: Lists all uploaded files from S3
- âœ… **Test Mode**: Returns mock data when AWS not configured
- âœ… **File Metadata**: Returns filename, size, type, upload date, S3 location
- âœ… **Category Detection**: Automatically categorizes as 'text' or 'audio'
- âœ… **MIME Type Inference**: Determines file type from extension
- âœ… **Sorting**: Returns stories sorted by upload date (newest first)
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Flow

1. **Home Screen** â†’ Two main buttons: "My Story Library" and "Add New Story"
2. **Library Screen** â†’ View all uploaded stories with search, filter, and sort
3. **Add Story Screen** â†’ Upload new text or audio files

      "uploadedAt": "2025-06-29T10:30:00.000Z",
      "category": "text"
    }
