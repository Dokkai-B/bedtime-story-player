## 💻 **For You (How to Run):**

### **Every Time You Want Her to Access the App:**

#### **Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**
1. **Double-click**: `backend/start-public-tunnel.bat`
2. **Wait for tunnel URL** (like `https://random-words.loca.lt`)
3. **Share the URL** with your girlfriend (just for testing)
4. **Keep the window open** while she uses the app

#### **Option 2: Manual Steps**
1. **Start backend**: `node server.js` (in backend folder)
2. **Start tunnel**: `npx localtunnel --port 3000`
3. **Note the URL** (changes each time)
4. **Keep both running**

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

### **URL Changes**
- **The tunnel URL changes** each time you restart (e.g., `https://new-random.loca.lt`)
- **Current APK uses**: `https://some-hairs-buy.loca.lt`
- **If you restart**, you'll need to:
  1. Update `lib/config/app_config.dart` with new URL
  2. Rebuild APK: `flutter build apk --release`
  3. Send new APK to your girlfriend

### **Tunnel Stability**
- **Keep the tunnel window open** while she uses the app
- **Free tunnels can disconnect** - if app stops working, restart tunnel
- **Backend must stay running** on your PC

### **Data Usage**
- **Uses internet bandwidth** for both of you
- **Audio streaming** will use mobile data if not on WiFi
- **Recommend WiFi** for large file uploads

---

## 🔧 **If URL Changes (Quick Fix):**

1. **Edit file**: `lib/config/app_config.dart`
2. **Find line**: `remoteServerHost = 'some-hairs-buy.loca.lt'`
3. **Replace with new URL** (without https://)
4. **Rebuild**: `flutter build apk --release`
5. **Send new APK** to girlfriend
