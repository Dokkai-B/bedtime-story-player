# Backend Fix Summary - July 1, 2025

## Problem Identified
After PC restart, the backend was running in S3 mode instead of test mode, causing:
- Stories to be served with UUID prefixes in filenames
- Playback failures due to filename mismatches
- App showing "testMode": false in API responses

## Root Cause
The `TEST_MODE` environment variable in `backend/.env` was set to `false`, causing the backend to attempt S3 operations instead of serving local files from `backend/test/samples/`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Environment Configuration
- Changed `TEST_MODE=false` to `TEST_MODE=true` in `backend/.env`
- This forces the backend to serve local files with clean filenames (no UUID prefixes)

### 2. Created Convenience Script
- Added `backend/start-test-mode.bat` for easy backend startup
- Script automatically sets test mode and starts the server
- Prevents future confusion about backend mode

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated `APK_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with:
  - Quick start instructions using the batch file
  - Manual setup steps
  - Troubleshooting for test mode issues
  - Note about PC restart behavior

## Verification Completed
✅ Backend API now returns `"testMode": true`
✅ Stories endpoint serves clean filenames without UUID prefixes:
  - `sample-audio.mp3` (not `UUID-sample-audio.mp3`)
  - `Record 2025-05-09 at 00h40m01s.mp3` (clean filename)
✅ Audio files are accessible via HTTP (Status 200)
✅ New debug APK built and ready for testing

## Files Modified
- `backend/.env` - Set TEST_MODE=true
- `backend/start-test-mode.bat` - New convenience script
- `APK_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Updated with test mode instructions
- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` - Rebuilt

## Next Steps
1. Test the app on both emulator and real device
2. Verify stories load and play correctly
3. Use `start-test-mode.bat` for future backend starts
4. If testing is successful, build final release APK

## Key Learning
Always verify `TEST_MODE=true` in `backend/.env` after PC restarts or environment changes. The batch file prevents this issue by explicitly setting the environment variable.
